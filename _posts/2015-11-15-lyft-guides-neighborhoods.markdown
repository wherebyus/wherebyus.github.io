description: "Lyft operates in hundreds of cities, but in Miami we're helping them create an unprecedented community impact. Together, we're helping locals explore and connect with Miami's unique neighborhoods. Each month, we share places to eat, drink, and explore; and cover the people, history, and future of a neighborhood — paired with an event and Lyft activation, alongside ongoing influencer marketing programs. The results? Dynamic experiences that our community returns to again and again, and deep engagement for our partner. We create more than 250,000 local engagements each month for Lyft, building new brand equity along the way."
