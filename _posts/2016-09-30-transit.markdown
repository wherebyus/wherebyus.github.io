description:  How do you change a city's conversation about transit? We worked with Miami-Dade County's Department of Transportation and Public Works to do just that. We started with human-centered research into how locals think about and use transportation, then leveraged those insights to design a campaign that included data journalism, multimedia storytelling, and experiential activations with our partners at Prism Creative Group. To date we've reached more than a million locals with new engagements on a complex local issue, and built lasting community connections in the process.
