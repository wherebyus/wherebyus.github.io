description:  When the developers of Miami's Arts + Entertainment District were looking to bring in a new restaurant concept, they knew they needed more than an ad. We designed A+Eats&#58; The Search for Miami's Next Great Restaurant — a public contest to give a year of rent-free space and buildout to a local restaurateur with a fresh concept. The New Tropic managed the submission and review process, backed by four months of content and social media engagement on Miami's growing food scene. More than 100 people applied, and more than 6,000 locals participated in the public voting process. We produced a livestreamed finale cookoff, where a winner was chosen by an expert panel. We reached more than 500,000 locals with the Arts + Entertainment District brand.
