description: In November 2015, we launched our Lyft partnership with a one-of-a-kind event â€” MiamiLand, an epic celebration of Miami's many neighborhoods. MiamiLand featured local food, drink, art and history from Homestead to Hialeah, and interactive exhibits from dozens of community organizations including amaker space, the opera, a public radio storytelling booth, museums, and more. Our goal was 300 people. We drew more than 1,300 locals to experience the magic of their hometown for one big night and kick off a year-long series of neighborhood guides and activations.
