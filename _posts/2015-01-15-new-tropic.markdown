description: We launched The New Tropic in January of 2015 as our pilot media and events brand in Miami. A year later, we were creating 750,000 engagements a month across the site, social media channels, and in-person experiences. The New Tropic has created field-leading engagement among millennials in Miami's urban core, and delivered strong connections with them for brands.
