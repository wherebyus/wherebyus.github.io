description: Miami's growing startup scene has been attracting talent, capital and plenty of buzz during the past few years. With all that energy comes an exponential need for connection and communication. We worked with Knight Foundation to create resources that help new arrivals get into the scene, find and hire talent, and raise capital. With ongoing multimedia storytelling, and a toolkit of curated, community-submitted resources, the startup guide weaves together and provides entry into Miami's burgeoning startup community.
